We started right away with breaking down common code, vs abstractable code, vs code we believed we could not abstract, because it worked with the classes very specifically. The breaking down of our classes was split 3 ways between, Harold, Andy, and Lee. Aayush was not present for this session. Harold then broke this down into pointed steps, while Lee found some similarities between how both classes functioned. We kept all these notes in a shared Goodle doc. Aayush and Andy were asked to write the test client at this point. We struggled with this project after that point. Spent most of the week very unsure on what was expected, and had some direction on Friday's class that really led us to being able to handle the problem set. Lee was able to resolve the code with iterators and various inheritence options, but had attempted to abstract some non-abstractble classes, which caused bugs. Everyone tried to solve the bugs. Eventually, we got some direction on our frustrations by talking with tutors, and realized you cannot abstract the remove function. We wrote the function out of our abstract code and it worked great. At this point Harold did some further formating, rewrote the entire test client, and we felt able to submit our project.

After our initial break down I really searched to try to find the answers for our project. I put together our Github, wrote a rudermentary test client, and tried to break down how the code worked as best as possible. Unfortunatly, we were all pretty lost on what to do. I spent a great deal of time on research, and finally put together the peices on how to abstract on Friday, then wrote our Abstract class in it's entirty. I had some family emergancies, and had to step away while it was still sending error messages, and unfortunatly left Harold and Andy a little lost on how to fix the project. They found tutors to help, and talked in Github about what they learned. I came back to the project the next day, finilized my debugging and after reading what they had done realized all that was needed was to resolve the remove method I had placed in abstractlist misguidedly. At this point it was some basic clean up, and a lot of explanation as to what the code was doing and why. Harold explored that with me extensivly, and I did my best to explain given my limited understanding. This project was a significant challenge and I hope that we found the solution we were searching for.

The project started out with us connecting on discord, similar to the last project, while the work we did was pushed to github to share. We ran the projects on our personal clients and communicated our intentions through discord to get the project done. I helped on the project by researching on the AbstractList class to help Harold and Lakashhar write it and I wrote the ListClient test with Aayush and Lakashhar, which helped to display the final result to see if everything was working.

In my perspective of the team project, I believe that I was a big part in our discussion to get things started and organized. 
Some other things I did were: I made a google doc so that everybody could get a good platform to build off of conceptually. I contributed bits and pieces of code in the AbstractList, mainly trying to get the remove and clear method to work, 
and had a small role in debugging. In the end, I remade the test client based off of the original
version of itself that Lee had made so that it would run more smoothly and output with more clarity. 
Added some comments to the code as well.

For this project our team started off by finding out what the main goal of this project is. We had come to the conclusion that what we needed to get done with the project was to make a program that would use ArrayList and LinkedList to create an AbstractList. I got tasked with implementing all the methods in the test method to see whether the program worked. As a team we diligently started working on the files and had a few run-ins with the code that prevented us from executing code, but we polished up the code to make it run properly. Our team was hard working throughout the project and worked/communicated properly. Throughout the project we used GitHub to work on the project together and see what changes were made to the project. We also communicated our ideas, problems, and doubts through Discord. Each member worked on their share of the project fairly and helped others when help was needed. Overall my take on this project was that we did start off slow but we managed to get done with what was required from us.
